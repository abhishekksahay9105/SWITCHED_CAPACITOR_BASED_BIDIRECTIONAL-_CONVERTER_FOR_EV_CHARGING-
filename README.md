# SWITCHED_CAPACITOR_BASED_BIDIRECTIONAL_CONVERTER_FOR_EV_CHARGING
1. First we have read "SC Basic", learnt about the uses of switched capacitor in converter.
2. The values of the capacitors and inductors used in the converter are simply decided on the basis of maximum current and voltage respectivily. The load-end capacitor should used choosed on the basis of charging and discharging time of the RC circuit.
3. Simulate it in MATLAB software.

4. Then we have study about MPPT(Maximum power point trancking) techniques used in solar panels, using "".
